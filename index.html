                <h3>How to create a basic blog page using just HTML and CSS</h3>
                <h4>1. Creating directory</h4>
                <p>In order to start your project you have to first create a fresh workspace and the first step to that is creating your new directory in your respective folder.</p>
                <h5>Steps</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open your workspace.</li>
                    <li>Create new folder called Blog</li>
                    <li>Open the folder in VS code</li>
                    <li>Create your html and css folder. In my case I have named it blog.html and style.css respective</li>
                </ol>
                <div>
                    <img src="./Screenshot 2024-11-23 183419.png"  class="how-to-image"/>
                </div>
                
                <h4>2. Creating html and linking with CSS</h4>
                <p>For the html to have the style component we link it with the css document in the head tag</p>
                <h5>Steps</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open your html document.</li>
                    <li><p>Type html5 and press enter, it should give you the basic html skeleton</p></li>
                    <li><p>In the header tag we type  &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt. This links the two files</p></li>
                </ol>
                <div>
                    <img src="./Screenshot 2024-11-23 185804.png"  class="how-to-image" />
                </div>

                <h4>3. Creating the header, title and hero component</h4>
                <p>Header and hero components are the most important part of the a website.Header is where the blog name appears whereas hero is the a large, prominent section located at the top of the homepage. 
                   Title is the name of the page that you see in the tab bar of the website</p>
                <h5>Steps</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Change your title tag that should be next to the meta tag inside the head section to your blog name.In my case I have named it the black cat developer</li>
                    <li>To create the header we create a header tag and than a div inside it.5</li>
                    <li>To create the hero section. We first start with section tag. This is a semantic tag that allows the easy readability of the code.</li>
                    <li>Now, start a div with class hero. The code snippet below will give you more detail about the class.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <div>
                    <img src="./Screenshot 2024-11-24 085328.png"  class="how-to-image"/>
                </div>

                <h4>3. Styling the header and hero component</h4>
                <p>Header and hero is first impression of the user. Therefore, it has to be eyecatchy and aesthically pleasing.</p>
                <h5>Steps</h5>

                <ol>
                    <li>Go to your Css document add the following code as shown in the code snippet</li>
                    <li>Here element selector is used to select the body where as a class is used to select the header and the hero classes.</li>
                    <li>Under the header class we have just edited its background and font style where as in hero section we have added a picture to the background well.</li>
                    <li>We have used margin in the body in order to eliminate any gap in header.</li>
                    <li>We have also declared a root element. In this case we have used it to declare a constant color that we will be using througout the website.</li>
                </ol>

                <div>

                    section is using div component to structure the elements.</p>

                    <li>We have used img tag to add image and classed it under how-to-image. We have assigned it under that particular class so that we can later edit it in the css.</li>
                </ol>
